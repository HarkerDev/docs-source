# Harker Development Docs

This is the homepage for the Harker Development Team Documentation. We are responsible for many applications used throughout the student and faculty. For a list of the projects checkout our homepage at [https://harkerdev.github.io](https://harkerdev.github.io).

Anybody can contribute to our open-source projects. These docs serve as a good starting point to get started and learn more about our stack and how we build our applications.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us at [dev@harker.org](mailto:dev@harker.org).
