## GitHub

All of our open-source development is on GitHub, where contricutors can suggest new features, report bugs, and also contribute to our code base. This guide serves as a guideline to interacting with our GitHub organization.

### Contributions

#### Commits

Each commit is an important part of the history of the project development. For each commit, make sure that

- Commit message begins with a capital letter
- Commit message is in past tense
- Commit message does not end in a period
- Contains a substantial code change (in other words, don't commit for a typo)

#### Pull Requests

Open a pull request to one of our repositories if you have made chances to the code base that you believe should be implemented into the production branch. This can be of any sort - bug squashing or feature implementation.

If your pull request references an open issue that details a bug report or feature request, make sure to include a `Resolves #[issue number]` in the body of the pull request, such that if it is merged then the issue will auto-close.

Things to include in your pull request:

- A clear title of the overview of the changes that were made
- In the body, a detailed description of the changes in each file in a bullet format
- `Resolves` keyword as mentioned above

#### Bug Reports

If there are bugs in any master branch, please report it by opening an issue in the repository. First make sure that there are no other issues that have been opened for the same bug. Then, in the bug report, include

- A clear title that starts with `Bug:` and describes the bug, with correct capitalization
- In the body, Steps taken to produce the issue such that any contributor can reproduce it in their own environment

#### Feature Suggestions

If you have an idea for a new feature that may be helpful in any Harker Dev project, feel free to open an issue. Again, make sure that the feature has not been suggested before. In your suggestion, include

- A clear title that starts with `Feature:` and describes the overall functionality of the feature, with correct capitalization
- In the body, a detailed description of the feature
