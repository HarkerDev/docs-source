To reference the partial page `views/partials/some-partial.ejs` from a page in `views/pages` in ejs, use the `include` function as so:

````html
<p> Here is some HTML </p>
<%- include('../partials/some-partial.ejs') %>
<p> Here is some HTML </p>
````

This will replace `<%- include('../partials/some-partial.ejs') %>` with whatever code is in `views/partials/some-partial.ejs`.
